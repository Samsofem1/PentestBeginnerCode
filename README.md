# PentestBeginnerCode
These are some codes and files I wrote/used during my first two weeks of advancing my programming skill in cybersecurity.

I have two password dictionaries here that I used to manupulate data just to master how python works.

BlockIps.py is a script that blocks access to some websites.
   This script first gets the IP addresses from websites that has been inputed in the folder named IPs
    After getting the IP addresses, it pushes them to a text file called ipaddresses.txt 
    After doing this, the code blocks the Ip and send it to another file called BlockedIps.txt
    
callfile.py is a script that collects all the passwords, words or strings that starts with letter "a" and save it as a new array a_s.
    I used callfile.py practicing with the passwords.save text file (which is an open source password dictionary). Just like the About of this Repo states, these are my beginner codes.
  
 matrix.py simply gets the inverse of a 3 by 3 matrix.
 
testrun.py is simply some array practices/play
